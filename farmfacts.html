  <h3 class="notokay">Inhumane Farming</h3>
  <P> Inhumane farming is a huge epidemic that affects everybody involved: The farmers, the consumers, and the animals.</p>
  <p>These farms, called "factory farms," use unjust practices and treat animals poorly.</P>
    <div class="center">
      <img src="https://awionline.org/sites/default/files/uploads/images/fa-factoryfarmpigs-092211.jpg">
    </div>
  <P> Cows, chickens, and pigs are often kept in one gigantic room, where they are forced to live in their own waste and diesese until the day they are slaughtered. </P>
  <P>Factory farms generate an enormous amount of waste that contaminates our air and water. In 2012, the largest factory farms produced almost 13 times more waste than the human population of the United States. The big meat and chicken companies take no responsibility for this waste—leaving it up to their contract farmers to figure out how to dispose of it. The only way to responsibly address the excess waste problem is to shift away from the factory farm model, rather than rely on false solutions such as manure to energy projects. </P>
  <P> In 2001, Emmpak Foods, Inc. recalled 235 tons of ground beef for being contaminated with E. coli. This event is thought to be in direct corallation with the death of a 2-year-old that had been diganosed with E. coli poisioning.</p>
  <p class=notokay>Don't let the past be for nothing. Stand up to inhumane farming. </P>
</div>
<div>
  <h3 class="okay">Humane Farming</h3>
  <P>People often find that the most humane farms are those not owned by major corporations. Humane farms limit pestisides, chemicals, and don't genetically modify their foods. They keep their animals under good conditions and make sure they are well-fed. </p>
  <P>You can tell what eggs from the store are from natuarly raised chickens because they will have a label of them that says "free range". Likewise, you should only buy meat with a grass-fed label on them sience cows and pigs are primarrly only supposed to eat grass. However, to make sure that you are getting the best possible food, look to see if your food is certified by the FDA. </P>
  <div class="center">

  </div>
  <P>If you buy food from local farms, then that means you will get fresher and overall better products. Locally shopping may be more expencive, but it's worth every penny. </P>
  <P>A very hot topic that is often associated with farming is the use of pesticides. A lesser-known trouble the environment faces as a result of pesticides are known as ‘persistent organic pollutants’ (POPs). POPs continue to poison non-target organisms in the environment and possibly increase chances to humans of disruption in the endocrine system, cancer, infertility and mutagenic effects, although very little is known about these ‘long-term chronic effects’ yet.
    A humane farm will limit pesticides and, if possible, will find non-toxic alternatives to pesticides. </P>
  <P class=okay>Together, we can change the way people think about food.</P>
